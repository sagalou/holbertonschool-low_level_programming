# Holberton School - Low Level Programming

## Description

This repository contains projects and exercises related to low-level programming in C, completed as part of the Holberton School curriculum.

This project focuses on nested loops, functions, function prototypes, header files, variable scope, and compilation using strict GCC flags. The objective is to understand how functions work internally in C and how to structure modular programs following the Betty coding style.
