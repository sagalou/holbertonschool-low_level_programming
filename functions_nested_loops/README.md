# C - Functions, nested loops

## Description
This project focuses on understanding and implementing functions and nested loops in C. It covers the basics of modular programming, function prototypes, header files, and variable scope.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, I am expected to be able to explain:
* What are nested loops and how to use them.
* What is a function and how to use them.
* The difference between a declaration and a definition of a function.
* What is a prototype and why it is used.
* The scope of variables.
* How to use header files.

## Requirements
* **Editors:** `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`.
* **System:** All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
* **Compiler:** `gcc` with flags `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`.
* **Style:** All code must follow the Betty style.
* **Standard Library:** Forbidden (no `printf`, `puts`, etc.). Only `_putchar` is allowed.

## Files
| File | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `main.h` | Header file containing all function prototypes. |
| `0-putchar.c` | Program that prints `_putchar`, followed by a new line. |
| `1-alphabet.c` | Function that prints the alphabet, in lowercase. |
| `2-print_alphabet_x10.c` | Function that prints 10 times the alphabet, in lowercase. |
| `3-islower.c` | Function that checks for lowercase character. |
| `4-isalpha.c` | Function that checks for alphabetic character. |
| `5-sign.c` | Function that prints the sign of a number. |
| `6-abs.c` | Function that computes the absolute value of an integer. |
| `7-print_last_digit.c` | Function that prints the last digit of a number. |
| `8-24_hours.c` | Function that prints every minute of the day (00:00 to 23:59). |
| `9-times_table.c` | Function that prints the 9 times table, starting with 0. |
| `10-add.c` | Function that adds two integers and returns the result. |
| `11-print_to_98.c` | Function that prints all natural numbers from n to 98. |
